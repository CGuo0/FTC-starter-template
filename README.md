# FTC Starter Template

Welcome to the **FTC Starter Template** — an codebase designed to help new teams and programmers learn how to build their first FTC robot software.

## What’s Included

-  **Mecanum Drive Subsystem**  
  Learn how to control a mecanum drivetrain with joystick input --> Fully set-up and ready to use

- ️ **Servo Controller Subsystem**  
  Examples of controlling both position and continuous rotation servos.

-  **Motor Controller Subsystem**  
  Basic motor control, including power setting and encoder usage.

-  **TeleOp Mode**  
  A working TeleOp example that connects gamepad inputs to robot movement.

-  **Modular Code Structure**  
  Clear folder organization with subsystems, and opmodes for organization


## Getting Started

1. **Open the project** in Android Studio.

2. **Update your robot configuration** names to match names in the code.

3. **Connect your Control Hub or Robot Controller phone**.

4. **Run the TeleOp mode** to test driving and servo controls.

## How to Use

- Drive your robot using the left and right joysticks.

- You may need to flip the direction of the motors

## Tips

Once thoroughly learning and understanding the examples in this template, you and your team may want to:

- Create different subsystems for intake/outtake, etc. 
- Set up odometry positioning for autonomous with roadrunner: https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner/releases
- Setting up **PRESETS** for your robot
  - Automated motions controlled by 1 button push (ex. automate scoring motion)

Happy coding and good luck!
